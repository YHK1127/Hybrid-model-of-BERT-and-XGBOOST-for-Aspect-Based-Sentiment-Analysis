# Hybrid-model-of-BERT-and-XGBOOST-for-Aspect-Based-Sentiment-Analysis

In present days Digital world was emerged with big data, in various fields such as marketing, online learning, business, etc. Here reviewing the customerâ€™s opinion in each field is more critical in enabling smart services. Opinion mining also referred as Sentimental analysis is an approach to Natural Language Processing (NLP) that identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text. Sentiment analysis can be done in three ways, i.e., based on how finely the text is processed: Document, Sentence, and Aspect. Aspect Based Sentimental Analysis can be done using Machine learning and Deep learning algorithms. In ABSA, sentiment polarity defines the orientation of the expressed sentiment of that aspect can be found by various techniques available in Machine Learning or Deep Learning. Although their individual implementations produced good results, the hybrid approach may produce much more efficient results. This work mentions such hybrid model which combines BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which is a transformer-based Machine learning technique for NLP and XGBOOST (Extreme Gradient Boosting) which is an ensembling technique and an extension of Gradient Boosting.
